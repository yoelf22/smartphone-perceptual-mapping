## 🎮 Usage Examples

### **Example 1: Marketing Team Analysis**
```javascript
// Question: "Does camera excellence translate to market success?"

1. Open dashboard → Select "Camera Quality" vs "Price Value"  
2. Observe bubble sizes (popularity) vs positioning
3. Result: Google Pixel 8 Pro has best camera (8.8) but low popularity (45%)
   → Opportunity: Better marketing of camera capabilities
```

### **Example 2: Product Manager Research**
```python
# Question: "Where should we position our new phone?"

1. Load average_brand_ratings.csv into Excel/Python
2. Analyze gaps in "Performance" vs "Battery Life" space
3. Result: Sweet spot at Performance=8.0, Battery=8.5 
   → Strategy: Focus on balanced performance + excellent battery
```

### **Example 3: Executive Strategic Decision**
```
Question: "Which phones are undervalued market opportunities?"

Dashboard Analysis:
• OnePlus 12: 8.7 Performance, only 35% popularity → Hidden gem
• Xiaomi 14 Pro: 8.5 Price Value, only 38% popularity → Value opportunity  

Strategic Insight: Acquire or partner with undervalued high-performers
```

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### **Custom Analysis with Python**

```python
import pandas as pd
from perceptual_map_analyzer import PerceptualMapAnalyzer

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('average_brand_ratings.csv')

# Initialize analyzer with popularity
analyzer = PerceptualMapAnalyzer(data, include_popularity=True)

# Create custom perceptual map
analyzer.create_perceptual_map('Camera_Quality', 'Price_Value')

# Analyze popularity-performance relationship  
analysis = analyzer.analyze_popularity_performance_relationship('Performance')
print(f"Correlation: {analysis['correlation_coefficient']}")

# Generate all 28 maps
analyzer.generate_all_dimension_maps(output_dir='all_maps/')
```
